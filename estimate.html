            <h2>SUNXCO PROJECT AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Agreement Overview</strong><br />
              This Agreement is made between the Parties and may only be
              modified as specified herein. The contract documents shall be
              governed by the laws of the State of Florida and are intended to
              be interpreted as mutually drafted. If any provision is found
              invalid, the remaining terms shall remain in effect. This
              Agreement supersedes all prior verbal and written discussions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            SunXco, through its approved dealer Epic Landscaping Inc., agrees to
            provide all labor and materials required for the project in
            accordance with the scope of work and specifications at the project
            site. All payments shall be made to Epic Landscaping Inc., the
            approved installer for SunXco pergolas.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Contract Documents</strong><br />
            This Agreement encompasses all details of the project scope,
            additional agreements, written instructions, and approved change
            orders. In case of conflicts, this Agreement shall prevail. The
            Owner must review and approve shop drawings before permits or
            product orders proceed. Any delay in approval may impact the project
            schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Payment Terms</strong><br />

            <li>30% Deposit upon contract execution.</li>
            <li>
              40%: (20% upon permit approval, 20% upon material delivery).
            </li>
            <li>20% Upon pergola final completion.</li>
            <li>10% Upon permit closure.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>4. Design Revisions and Change Orders</strong><br />
            Up to three (3) design revisions are included in the contract price.
            Any additional modifications or engineering fees exceeding $1,500
            shall be the Owner’s responsibility. Changes to the scope or
            specifications shall be documented through a signed Change Order and
            may impact project costs and timelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>5. Scheduling, Site Access, and Delivery</strong><br />
            Epic Landscaping Inc. will make every reasonable effort to complete
            the project on schedule. However, permitting and regulatory
            approvals may affect the timeline. The Owner must ensure all
            preparatory work is completed as per approved shop drawings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6. Warranty and Disclaimer</strong><br />
            The SunXco pergola system is engineered to withstand various weather
            conditions but is not guaranteed to be 100% watertight under extreme
            rain or wind conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>7. Dispute Resolution</strong><br />
            Before initiating legal action, Epic Landscaping Inc. shall have the
            right to address and remedy any construction defects. As per Florida
            law (Chapter 558, Florida Statutes), claims must go through a notice
            and cure process.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>8. Insurance</strong><br />
            The Owner shall maintain standard property and liability insurance.
            Epic Landscaping Inc. shall maintain general liability coverage with
            limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>9. Homeowner’s Association and Historic Approvals</strong
            ><br />
            The Owner is responsible for obtaining any necessary Homeowner’s
            Association (HOA) or historic district approvals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>10. Construction Liens</strong><br />
            Under Florida’s Construction Lien Law (Sections 713.001 - 713.37),
            contractors and suppliers who are unpaid may file a lien against the
            property.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>11. Modifications and Waivers</strong><br />
            No modifications to this Agreement shall be valid unless made in
            writing and signed by both Parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>12. Limitation of Liability</strong><br />
            Epic Landscaping Inc. and the Owner waive claims for consequential
            damages, including but not limited to loss of use, business revenue,
            or reputation damages.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>13. Termination Policy</strong><br />
            Due to the custom nature of SunXco pergola systems, orders cannot be
            canceled once placed. Payments made up to that point are
            non-refundable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>14. Cleanup Responsibility</strong><br />
            Epic Landscaping Inc. shall maintain a clean and organized job site,
            ensuring all debris is removed upon project completion.
